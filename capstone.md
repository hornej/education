# Chapter 1: Getting Started

**4 principles:**
1. The job of the product development team is to create a design that is desirable and transferable  
2. The design must evolve, gradually becoming better, more mature, and until it contains all the necessary information for the production system to manufacture the product and test its quality  
3. The product development team causes design evolution through design activities  
4. Optimal evolution requires customization and coordination of activities

# Chapter 4: Opportunity Development

Opportunity Development is the first step of product development.  

Project Objective Statement (design brief or mission statement) is a brief summary of the scope, schedule, and resources of the project.  

Validate, don’t assume. Get feedback early!

Well-defined opportunity:

1. Market requirements  
    - Key factors that determine desirability   
    - 5-20 requirements  
    - Market requirements should be approved by the market (the development team is not the market)
2. Performance measures  
    - Best to have quantitative unit measurements
3. Requirement-measure relationships  
    - The relationships should not be strictly one-to-one
4. Ideal values  
    - The value the market most prefers

Very rough models, prototypes, and sketches can be helpful to communicate with customers and get feedback.  

How to gather and process essential information
1. Representing the market  
    - Find the correct market representatives
2. Understanding the market  
    - Surveys
    - Focus groups
    - Interviews
    - Observational studies
    - Product benchmarking
      - Technical
      - Market
    - Capturing customer statements
    - Developing a requirements hierarchy
    - Developing performance measures
    - Determining requirement-measure relationships
    - Determining ideal values

This process requires interaction with the client and the market.

# Product Development Reference

### Basic Design Process

1. Understand the need (Engage/Observe)
2. Explore concepts (Diverge/Converge)
3. Define the design (Model/Experiment)
4. Test the design (Prototype/Evaluate)
5. Refine the design

### Benchmarking
> Benchmarking is a process of developing a thorough understanding of competitive products. These products are evaluated to determine how well the market likes the product, key strengths and weaknesses, the performance of the product on the performance measures, the concepts used in the product, and the estimated manufacturing cost of the product.

- Market Benchmarking
- Technical Benchmarking
- Design Benchmarking

### Bill of Materials

### Bio-Inspired Design
> Bio-inspired design (sometimes called biomimicry or nature inspired design) is a solution exploration strategy that investigates nature’s solution to problems. The purpose of the strategy is to identify new solution principles from nature to inspire the development of analogous technical systems.

### Brainstorming

Osborn's Rules for Brainstorming
1. Focus on Quantity
2. Withhold Criticism
3. Welcome Unusual Ideas
4. Combine and Improve Ideas

### CAD Modeling

### Catalog Search

### Codes and Standards
> Many products will be governed by relevant codes and standards. In such cases, the standards describe performance measures that must be met in order to sell the product. The standards also often prescribe test methods for measuring the required performance. Using codes and standards helps ensure your product will be successful, and allows you to build on the expertise of the standard writers, rather than having to create all of that knowledge yourself.

### Concept Classification Tree
> A concept classi cation tree graphically presents the different branches explored when generating alternative solutions or concepts.

### Controlled Convergence

### Cost Estimation

### Cost Targets

1. Calculate total BOM cost
2. BOM cost * 2 = Manufacturer's selling price to you
3. Manufacturer's selling price to you * 2 = Selling price to retailer
4. Selling price to retailer * 2 = What the consumer will pay

### Critical Path Analysis
> In any design activity map, there is a critical path that limits the minimum time required to complete the map. An important characteristic of the critical path is that if any activity on it is delayed, it delays the completion of the entire map. Activities not on the critical path have a window within which they can be completed; any delay within that window does not delay the completion of the entire map. To that end, understanding, tracking, and managing the critical path is essential to completing the map on time.

### Decomposition

Solve difficult problems one at a time

### Delphi Method
> The Delphi method or Delphi technique is a method for obtaining information relevant to the design from experts in related fields.

- Informal Delphi Method
- Formal Delphi Method

### Design for Assembly

- Minimize the total number of parts
- Minimize assembly surfaces
- Avoid separate fasteners
- Minimize assembly instructions
- Maximize lead-in assembly
- Minimize handling in assembly

### Design for Manufacturing

### Design for Experiments

### Design Review

### Design Structure Matrix

### Dimensional Analysis
> Dimensional analysis is a method of determining a minimal set of parameters that will affect the performance of a design. It provides scaling factors that help compare different designs using the same principles. A result of dimensional analysis is a set of dimensionless groups that can be correlated with product performance across a wide range of conditions.

### Drawing Checking

### Drawings
> Engineering or technical drawings are used to fully and clearly de ne the design of an engineered product. Drawings communicate all needed information from the designer of the product to the production system to ensure that the product will match the design intent in all important ways.

### Engineering Change Order (ECO)

### Ergonomics
> The interface between humans and technical products is called product ergonomics. When establishing product ergonomics, designers consider the characteristics, abilities, and needs of humans (Pahl et al., 2007) as well as the needs of the product.

- Biomechanical Issues
- Physiological Issues
- Pyschological Issues

### Experimentation

1. Plan experiments before you do them
2. Test at multiple conditions
3. Complete all non-destructive tests before potentially destructive tests
4. Record all data and setup information necessary to perform the experiment
5. Calculate preliminary results during experimentation
6. Analyze the data statistically
7. Prepare a written summary with at least one summary data plot

### Failure Modes and Effects Analysis

### Fault Tree Analysis

### Financial Analysis
> Financial Analysis is a set of methods used to predict and track the financial implications of decisions made during product development. It is used to support decisions about what is to be developed. It is also used to support decisions about specific activities to be undertaken during product development.

- Payback analysis
- Net present value

### Finite Element Modeling

### Focus Groups
> A focus group is a group of 6-10 individuals who are asked a series of open-ended questions by a moderator in order to understand how they feel about a product or service. Properly done, focus groups can be a rich source of qualitative understanding about the desires of the market.

### Goal Pyramid
- Constraints
- Key Requirements
- Stretch Goals
- Basic Requirements

### Internet Research

### Interviews
> Interviews allow product development team members to have direct contact with people pertinent to the development project. Direct contact helps the team member get a firsthand account of needs, product use, opinions, complaints, difficulties, and so on. Interviews can be done with one, or with a few participants. One-on-one interviews are valuable because a participant’s responses are uninfluenced by other participants. Small group interviews can be good because participants often have insightful dialogue with other participants.
A primary goal of interviewing should be to elicit an honest response from participants1. Don’t be mistaken; this is very hard to do.

Example questions:
- When do you use this type of product?
- Why do you use this type of product?
- Walk us through a typical session using the product.
- What features do you like in this product?
- What features do you dislike in this product?
- What do you consider when buying a product like this?
- If there were no limitations, what would you do to improve this product?

### Method 635
> To carry out the activity, 6 people familiarize themselves with the problem at hand. Each creates and writes down 3 candidate solutions. The list of candidate solutions is then passed to the next participant, who adds 3 more candidates by building on the ideas from the previous participant. The built-upon-ideas are then passed to the next participant and eventually through all participants.
Hence the name 635; 6 participants, 3 ideas each, further developed by 5 other people.
By the end of the method (typically 30 to 60 minutes later), there will be 6 lists of candidate solutions, each of which contains 18 systematically developed candidates, for a total of 108 solution candidates.
