# Chapter 1: Getting Started

**4 principles:**
1. The job of the product development team is to create a design that is desirable and transferable  
2. The design must evolve, gradually becoming better, more mature, and until it contains all the necessary information for the production system to manufacture the product and test its quality  
3. The product development team causes design evolution through design activities  
4. Optimal evolution requires customization and coordination of activities

# Chapter 4: Opportunity Development

Opportunity Development is the first step of product development.  

Project Objective Statement (design brief or mission statement) is a brief summary of the scope, schedule, and resources of the project.  

Validate, donâ€™t assume. Get feedback early!

Well-defined opportunity:

1. Market requirements  
    - Key factors that determine desirability   
    - 5-20 requirements  
    - Market requirements should be approved by the market (the development team is not the market)
2. Performance measures  
    - Best to have quantitative unit measurements
3. Requirement-measure relationships  
    - The relationships should not be strictly one-to-one
4. Ideal values  
    - The value the market most prefers

Very rough models, prototypes, and sketches can be helpful to communicate with customers and get feedback.  

How to gather and process essential information
1. Representing the market  
    - Find the correct market representatives
2. Understanding the market  
    - Surveys
    - Focus groups
    - Interviews
    - Observational studies
    - Product benchmarking
      - Technical
      - Market
    - Capturing customer statements
    - Developing a requirements hierarchy
    - Developing performance measures
    - Determining requirement-measure relationships
    - Determining ideal values

This process requires interaction with the client and the market.

# Chapter 5: Concept Development

**REQUIREMENTS**
- Subsystem requirements
  - Rather than using market requirements, the subsystem opportunity definition uses selected system performance measures as the subsystem requirements
- Target values for the system and subsystems
  - Basic requirements
    - Have a minimal effect on the market perception
    - Do not spend significant effort to optimize
  - Constraints
    - Target values that MUST be met
  - Key performance measures
    - Target values that have a strong effect on the market's perception
  - Stretch goals
    - Would be amazing to reach but somewhat unlikely

**TESTS**
- Evaluate alternative concepts.  
- Provide evidence that the product is desirable.  

**MODELS**
- Rough technical models of the concept.  
- Evaluation of competitive products.
- Relationships between subsystems.

**PROTOTYPES**
- Make prototypes that show the definition of the product rather than the purpose of the product.

**DESIGN**
- Definition of the concept
  - Describes the means for achieving major market requirements
  - Takes the form of sketches and graphical representation
  - Must be clear enough to be understood by a 3rd party
- Decomposition of the concept
  - List of the subsystems
  - Visual representation of the relationships between subsystems
- Subsystem interface definitions
  - Interface matrix
  - Interface Control Drawing
- Bill of materials
  - List of major parts

## Basic Design Process

- Understand the need
  - Engage the outside world
  - Observe customers
- Explore concepts
  - Diverge different concepts
  - Converge on one idea
- Define the design
  - Model the details
  - Experiment and improve
- Test the design
  - Prototype physical concepts
  - Evaluate the performance
- Refine the design

# Exercises

1. Requirements
2. Tests
3. Design
