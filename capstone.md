# Chapter 1: Getting Started

**4 principles:**

1. The job of the product development team is to create a design that is desirable and transferable  
2. The design must evolve, gradually becoming better, more mature, and until it contains all the necessary information for the production system to manufacture the product and test its quality  
3. The product development team causes design evolution through design activities  
4. Optimal evolution requires customization and coordination of activities

# Chapter 4: Opportunity Development

Opportunity Development is the first step of product development.  

Project Objective Statement (design brief or mission statement) is a brief summary of the scope, schedule, and resources of the project.  

Validate, donâ€™t assume. Get feedback early!

Well-defined opportunity:

1. Market requirements  
  - Key factors that determine desirability   
  - 5-20 requirements  
  - Market requirements should be approved by the market (the development team is not the market)
2. Performance measures  
  - Best to have quantitative unit measurements
3. Requirement-measure relationships  
  - The relationships should not be strictly one-to-one
4. Ideal values  
  - The value the market most prefers

Very rough models, prototypes, and sketches can be helpful to communicate with customers and get feedback.  

How to gather and process essential information
1. Representing the market  
  - Find the correct market representatives
2. Understanding the market  
  - Surveys
  - Focus groups
  - Interviews
  - Observational studies
  - Product benchmarking
    - Technical
    - Market
  - Capturing customer statements
  - Developing a requirements hierarchy
  - Developing performance measures
  - Determining requirement-measure relationships
  - Determining ideal values

This process requires interaction with the client and the market.

## Basic Design Process

- Understand the need
  - Engage the outside world
  - Observe customers
- Explore concepts
  - Diverge different concepts
  - Converge on one idea
- Define the design
  - Model the details
  - Experiment and improve
- Test the design
  - Prototype physical concepts
  - Evaluate the performance
- Refine the design

# Exercises

**T2-1 What are the three kinds of design artifacts that evolve during the product development process?**

1. Requirements
2. Tests
3. Design

**T2-5 What are the three different evaluations methods used to obtain approval?**

1. Artifact checks
2. Performance tests
3. Validation tests

**T4-1 List three characteristics of the project that are included in the project objective statement:**

1. Scope
2. Schedule
3. Resources

**T4-4 List six guidelines for writing effective product-focused requirement statements:**

1. Express the requirement with positive, not negative phrasing
2. Express the requirement as specifically as the user statement
3. Express the requirement as a requirement of the product, not the environment of the user
4. Express a requirement, rather than a performance measure  
5. Express a requirement, rather than a product feature
6. Express the requirement independent from its importance

**T5-2 List the required content of the requirements, tests, and design at the end of the concept development stage.**

- Subsystem requirements
- Target value for the system and the subsystems
- Justification for concept selection, including model analysis and/or prototype test data demonstrating concept feasibility
- Geometric and other appropriate definition of the concept
- Decomposition of product concept into subsystems
- Subsystem interface definitions
- Preliminary Bill of Materials

1. Create a candidate solution set
2. Reduce the candidate solution set
3. Rate the concepts
4. Combine and improve candidates
5. Choose the best concept
